Landing page originally created by [@craftzdog](https://github.com/craftzdog) and coded along his video tutorial.

I followed this tutorial in order to learn new approaches on handling several visual effects commonly used in landing pages, like on load animations, parallax, sticky scroll, etc.

NOTE: in order to keep a minimalistic repo, the folder public/assets has been added to `.gitignore` so if you intend to use this, you will need the following resources:

- A background video `video.mp4` (used in `Masthead.tsx`)
- A logo `logo.svg` (used in `Masthead.tsx`)
- An arrow down icon `arrow-down.png` (used in `Masthead.tsx`)
