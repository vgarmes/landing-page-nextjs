Landing page originally created by [@craftzdog](https://github.com/craftzdog) and coded along his video tutorial.

I followed this tutorial in order to learn new approaches on handling several visual effects commonly used in landing pages, like on load animations, parallax, sticky scroll, etc.

NOTE: A folder `public/assets` with assets for the project is required but it has been ommited in this repo in order to keep its size small. Therefore, if you want to clone this project you will have to add the folder and the following files:

- A background video `video.mp4` (used in `Masthead.tsx`)
- A logo `logo.svg` (used in `Masthead.tsx`)
- An arrow down icon `arrow-down.png` (used in `Masthead.tsx`)
